"""Time sync service.

Sets the C3's clocks at boot:

- If the GPS is already on, use the GPS time.
- Otherwise, if the external RTC (rtc1, the RV-3028 on the backup capacitor) has a valid time, use
  that. This is the normal boot.
- Otherwise (first boot, or powered off long enough for the capacitor to run out), turn on the GPS,
  wait for it to sync its clock to GPS time, and use the GPS time. Turn the GPS back off afterwards
  if this service turned it on.

The GPS time comes from the GPS card's time sync TPDO (``[scet]`` in oresat-configs gps.yaml). It
is only used once the GPS card reports ``time_syncd`` (GPS TPDO 7), because before that the scet is
just the GPS card's own unsynced clock.

"Setting the clocks" means the C3's system clock (what all C3 software reads) and rtc0 (the
Octavo's internal RTC). rtc1 is also set when the time comes from the GPS.
